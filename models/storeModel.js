    the slug is the same as the name, should I made the slug a virtual field ?

    WHY I DECIDED TO REMOVE IT?
    - storing the slug as a static field whiles itâ€™s just a transformation of storeName could lead to 
    redundant data and extra updates when storeName changes.
    I could've made it a virtual field but I don't think it's necessary.
