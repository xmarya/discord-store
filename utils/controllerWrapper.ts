  // 1) this answer helped me to find out how to forward the Controller original parameters:
  // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66180541/convert-function-to-async-function-without-redefining

  // 2) OLD PROBLEM: for typing the Controller to take args without knowing how many they are and what are their types,
  //    there is a TypeScript utility called Parameters
  //    this utility type extracts the parameter types of a function type as a tuple.
  //    ...args: Parameters<Controller>:
  //    The args in the returned function : return async (...args: Parameters<Controller>)
  //    are typed using Parameters<Controller>, ensuring that the arguments passed to Controller : Controller(...args) 
  //    match the expected parameter types in this line: type Controller = (...args: any[]) => void;
